## Welcome to Brett Eaton's GitHub directory

This page is designed to host various ongoing research projects. Most of the material here is in the form of R Notebooks, which present both the code for analysis and some interpretive text. The source code file can be downloaded (see the `code` button at the top of each page), and modified. The underlying idea is to contribute to  Reproducible Research (RR) in the field of geomorphology. People can explore both the ideas and interpretation that I am working on, and explore the code itself. After all, the devil is in the details.

## Rethinking channel stability
My group has recently been focussing on the threshold separating channels in what we might call "dynamic equilibrium" from those that are unstabile, and which experience rapid changes in channel pattern. Our experimental data suggests that the characteristics of sediment transport are differnt during these (brief) periods of instability, and that a negative feedback between mean boundary shear stress and bank erosion makes periods of instability very brief, bringing systems back into what M. Church would classify as a threshold state. To be clear, we are most interested in steep gravel bed rivers with alluvial boundaries, and many of these ideas probably do not apply to labile sand bed streams. Interestingly, the evidence that our collaborators at BGC Enginnering have collected in the field suggests that large floods on fans also behave in much the same way as our laboratory experiments.

### The physics of channel stability
Anyway, the first idea in this theme is that we should probably refine our thinking about the physics of stream channel stability. See this [R Notebook webpage](https://bceaton.github.io/bed_stability_notebook.nb.html) for our initial ideas. Feel free to download the code, and play with the analysis we present. All you need is R Studio (which is free to download). You  may also need the [bibliography file](https://bceaton.github.io/MasterBibliography.bib) if you want to compile the notebook and to include the references that I have placed in there.
